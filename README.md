# 🛒 E-commerce Product Browser  
> Mini Project – Young Developer Power 2025 (Fullstack Track)

A simple and responsive **E-commerce Product Browser** that fetches real product data from [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com).  
This project was built to demonstrate **frontend–backend integration**, **responsive UI**, and **clean code architecture** using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project allows users to:
- Browse all products fetched from a live API  
- View essential product information (title, price, image, and category)  
- Navigate to detailed product view (optional / if implemented)
- Enjoy a clean and mobile-friendly UI design

> 🎯 Focus: Functionality, Code Quality, and User Experience (Responsive)
